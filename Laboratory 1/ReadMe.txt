Namit Sambare -- Lab 1
Namit's First 332 LAB
There were no errors I ran into on my first build. 
I tested the following inputs: 

1. This is the55 first 332 lab. Idontreallyknowwhatagoodtestq341231321isforthis 23482342384723
Line 2 ---- The result was as expected.  The words that are only digits (332, 23482342384723, 2) were correctly identified and printed at the bottom of the program's printed outputs. 

2. This is the55 first 332 lab. ----- The result was as expected. The words that are only digits (332) was correctly identified and printed at the bottom of the program's printed output. 

3. (3 blank lines) 567 ----- the result was as expected. The 3 blank lines didn't affect the program and only the 567 was printed. 

4. (3 blank lines) coconut coconut 567 ----- The result was as expected. coconut coconut 567 on three separate lines was what printed. This is what I expected to be printed as well. The blank lines shouldn't affect anything. 

5. (blank input) ---- the result was as expected as nothing was printed as it should have been. 

6. 7373namit7347 ---- The result was as expected as 7474namit7347 was printed, as it should have been. No individual digits were printed as no word is all digits. 

7. 737 3namit7347 ---- The result was as expected as 3namit7347 was printed and the words that were all digits printed was 737, just as it should have been. 

8. Also, when I ran the echo %errorlevel% command after the program finished running, the error level value returned was 0.
